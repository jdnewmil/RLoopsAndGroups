# R Loops and Groups

A presentation on Loops, Functions and Groups

This repository contains the source R Markdown file and supporting files for making the presentation.

To build the presentation, either open the Rmd file in RStudio and click the "Knit" button ("Knit to moon-reader" pulldown menu option) or make sure the `rmarkdown` and `xaringan` package and all packages mentioned in the Rmd file are installed and use `rmarkdown::render( "DoItAgainR.Rmd" )` to compile it to HTML format. Use a modern browser like Firefox or Chrome to view the presentation. Press `h` for help on controlling the slides.

The presentation itself can be viewed at https://jdnewmil.github.io/RLoopsAndGroups/DoItAgainR.html
